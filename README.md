# SeeAuthZ
SeeAuthZ is a research tool developed by the [Software Engineering Group](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/st/index.php?language=en) of the University of Bremen for extracting the implemented authorization policy of Java applications. We published a paper at [SCAM'20](http://www.ieee-scam.org/2020/) with details on the implemented algorithm and a first evaluation.

## Configuration
TBC

## Implementation
Our implementation is based on [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot), a great framework for static analysis of Java code. Furthermore, we use [Vasco](https://github.com/rohanpadhye/vasco) for the inter-procedural analysis part.

## Get Access
Currently, we are preparing a binary release of SeeAuthZ. If you are impatient, don't hesitate to write a short mail.
